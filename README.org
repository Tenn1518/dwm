#+TITLE: my dynamic window manager config
#+TODO: DEL(d)
* Patches
** Applied
*** [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/attachbottom/][attachbottom]]
New clients open at the bottom of the stack, instead of replacing master.
*** [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/autostart][autostart]]
Run the script =~/.local/share/dwm/autostart.sh= at startup.
*** [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/cursorwarp][cursorwarp]]
Cursor is automatically moved to middle of window whenever focus shifts.  Focus
doesn't shift when creating/killing windows, but I might replace this diff with
that diff.
*** [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/deck][deck]]
Layout: Only two windows, master and first window on stack, are shown.
*** DEL [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/movestack][movestack]]
*** [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/rotatestack][rotatestack]]
=s-S-J= and =s-S-K= to move windows around stack, a la xmonad.
*** [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/systray][systray]]
System tray icons are displayed on the dwm bar.
** Planned additions
*** [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/focusmaster/][focusmaster]]
Key to focus the master window immediately.
*** [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/inplacerotate/][inplacerotate]]
(Hopefully) rotate clients in stack without disturbing master or focus.  This
would be useful in the deck layout to "flip through" windows in the stack.
